            <h2>About Mojo.</h2>
              <p>Mojo Digital Solutions is a business name that was registered in June 2013 after I completed a Bachelor Degree of Media Arts from the University of South Australia. My aim when registering the business, was to work as freelance web designer. My major then was Web technology and sub major graphic design. The department of the university relevant to this dicipline was located in the communications and languages area at Magill. Obviously a bachelor degree involves a lot more than building websites and using design software packages. </p>

              <h3> A little background</h3>
              <p class="hidden-sm hidden-xs ">I had reached a crossroad in my life and aged 45 after being made reduntant and going through a traumatic set of circumstances decided that study and a new career path was the way forward. Perhaps in hindsight a little naieve... but then isn't that what we are told to do in society retrain and be useful?
